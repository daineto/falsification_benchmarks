# ARCH-COMP Falsification Benchmarks for PDDL+ Planning
PDDL+ instances translated from models of the ARCH-COMP falsification competition

Benchmark models include Automatic Transmission (AT) and Chasing Cars (CC).

For each safety requirement R, we define a PDDL+ domain "R_domain.pddl" and 6 instances "R.k.instance.pddl" where k indicates a discretization level.
